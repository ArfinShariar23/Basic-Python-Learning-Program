x = 10
y = 5

#Assignment Operation
print(x+y) #addition
print(x-y) #Substraction
print(x*y) #Multiplication
print(x/y) #division
print(x%y) #modulas
print(x**y) #exponantial

#This all are called arithmetic operation

#Relational Operator
if x == y: # == is a relational operator
    print("They are Equal")

if x>y: # > is a relational operator
    print("x is greater then y")

if x<y: # < is a relational operator
    print("x is less then y")

if x<=y: # <= is a relational operator
    print("x is equal or less then y")

if x>=y: # >= is a relational operator
    print("x is equal or greater then y")
